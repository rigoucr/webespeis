<html><body><div><p>For the third session of the Ubuntu Testing Days,
<a href="https://plus.google.com/+KevinGunnCanonical">Kevin Gunn</a> joined us to talk
about the Unity8 snap.</p>
<p>This is a thriving project with lots of things to do and bugs to uncover, so
it's the perfect candidate for newcomers eager to help Ubuntu.</p>

<p>To install Unity 8 in the Ubuntu 16.04
<a href="http://elopio.net/blog/pristine-vm/">cloned virtual machine</a>
that we prepared on the past session, enter the following commands in the terminal:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ sudo add-apt-repository -u ppa:ci-train-ppa-service/stable-phone-overlay
$ sudo apt install unity8-session-snap
$ unity8-snap-install
$ sudo reboot
</pre>


<p>After reboot, on the login screen click the Ubuntu icon next to your user name
and change the selection to Unity 8.</p>
<p>Kevin and his team have a
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o-jKITqUxRsujmN3OwRj3wRnn6dgblKuvrhKjeN8-Wc/edit#heading=h.q06bivmaid8f">google doc with the instructions to build and install the snap, and the
current status</a>.
If you find a bug, you can talk to the developers joining the
<a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#ubuntu-touch">#ubuntu-touch IRC channel on freenode</a></p>
<p>While preparing the testing environment on this session we had a crash, and
explained how easy it is to send the report to the Ubuntu developers by just
clicking the <em>Report problem...</em> button. The reports from all our users
are in the <a href="https://errors.ubuntu.com/">error tracker</a>, along with a frequency
graph and the links to bug reports where those crashes are being fixed.</p>
<p>We also showed two tricks to make faster and more pleasant the testing session
in a virtual machine:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://elopio.net/blog/setup-apt-cache/">Set up a cache for deb packages</a></li>
<li><a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/858649/how-can-i-copypaste-from-the-host-to-a-kvm-guest">Share the clipboard between the host and the guest</a></li>
</ul>
